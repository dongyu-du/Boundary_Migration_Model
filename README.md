# Boundary Migration Model Code & Datasets

This repository contains data and code for the paper __[A boundary migration model for imaging within volumetric scattering media](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30948-7)__ by Dongyu Du, Xin Jin, Rujia Deng et al. 

## Data
The provided data are all captured in the polyethylene foam scenario. The object is the Lambertian letter ‘T’ which is located at different depths from 2cm to 8cm inside the foam. As the description in the main text, the total thicknesses of the foam are 9cm to 15cm.
